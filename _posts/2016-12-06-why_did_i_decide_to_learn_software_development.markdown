I was an undergraduate in college studying aerospace engineering. I found that it wasn't for me, but didn't know what would spark my passion. After dabbling in different areas, I took an Introduction to Computer Science class and was immediately hooked. I'm not sure what exactly hooked me. I think the big attraction for me may have been that, unlike physical engineering disciplines, where I could foresee years of theoretical classroom hours, creating my first Hello, World! program produced immediate results. I had built something real, myself, right now!
